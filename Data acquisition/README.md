In this folder, you will find the .aia and .apk versions of the android app.

The .aia is the file you will use to edit the app on the MIT App Inventor website. I apologize if any label or name is not written in english.

The .apk is the file you will use to install the app on your smartphone to receive the bluetooth data coming from the board. If you don't trust this file, you can upload the .aia to the AI2 website, check the code and compile your own .apk file.

The .ino is the Arduino IDE file that goes into your board. It is made to work with the Seeed XIAO nRF52840 BLE Sense board, but, of course can be adapted to work with the board and sensors you have available.
