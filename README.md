### This project aims to help people by acting as a personal trainer during your training sessions by using TinyML to identify when and if an exercise is being done correctly or not.

In this repository you will find links to the Edge Impulse public version of the project along with the arduino library generated by the EI and a working code to visualize through LEDs the inference result when running the code on the development board. **Sometime in the next weeks there will also be the code version using bluetooth to communicate with an android app.**
